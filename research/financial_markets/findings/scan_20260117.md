## Analysis

### Black-Scholes Calculation

```
Spot (S): $95,448
Strike (K): $1,000,000
Time (T): Unknown (GTA VI release)
Volatility (σ): 55%
Risk-free rate (r): 5%

d2 = [ln(95448/1000000) + (0.05 - 0.5 * 0.55²) * T] / (0.55 * √T)

For any reasonable T (1-10 years):
  P(BTC > $1M) ≈ 0%
```

### Why Market Says 48.5%

1. **Unknown expiry** - GTA VI has no release date
2. **Long horizon** - If "before GTA VI" means 20+ years, probability increases
3. **Fat tails** - BTC had 100x moves in past (not captured by lognormal)
4. **Speculation** - Market may be pricing in "moonshot" scenario

### Is This Actionable?

**Probably not.** The edge calculation assumes:
- Known time to expiry (we don't have it)
- Lognormal price distribution (BTC doesn't follow this)
- Constant volatility (it's not)

The 48.5% price may be "rational" if:
- Time horizon is 30+ years
- BTC has a small but real chance of replacing gold/USD

## Limitations

1. **Only 1 market matched** - Need better pattern recognition
2. **Unknown expiry** - Can't apply Black-Scholes reliably
3. **Fat tails** - Model underestimates extreme moves

## Conclusion

The financial markets strategy **works technically** but has limited applicability:
- Few crypto price threshold markets exist on Polymarket
- Most that exist have fuzzy expiry dates
- Black-Scholes may not be appropriate for long-dated crypto bets
