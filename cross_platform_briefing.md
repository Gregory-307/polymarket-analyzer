# Cross-Platform Analysis

## Result

**No overlapping markets found.**

Scanned 200 Polymarket markets and 100 Kalshi non-sports markets. Zero matches.

## Why

The platforms trade different things:
- **Polymarket**: Trump deportation numbers, cabinet confirmations, near-term politics
- **Kalshi**: Mars colonization, next Pope, climate milestones - long-term speculative

There's no event traded on both platforms right now.

## When This Would Work

Cross-platform arbitrage requires identical events. Historical overlap existed during:
- 2024 US presidential election
- Fed rate decisions

Current state: platforms have diverged. No actionable opportunity.

## Conclusion

Built the infrastructure. No current use case. Would need to monitor for future overlap (e.g., 2026 midterms, major Fed meetings).
