# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

## The Favorite-Longshot Bias

![Market Distribution](results/visualizations/honest_summary.png)

### Academic Sources

**Kahneman & Tversky (1979)**
*Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk.* Econometrica, 47(2), 263-291.

> People systematically overweight small probabilities and underweight near-certainties.

| True Probability | Perceived Weight | Effect |
|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| 1% | ~5.5% | Longshots overbid 5.5x |
| 5% | ~13.2% | Longshots overbid 2.6x |
| 95% | ~79.3% | **Favorites underbid** |
| 99% | ~91.2% | **Favorites underbid** |

**Snowberg & Wolfers (2010)**
*Explaining the Favorite-Long Shot Bias.* [NBER Working Paper 15923](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15923).

| Implied Prob | Actual Win Rate | Edge |
|--------------|-----------------|------|
| 90.9% | 93.2% | **+2.3%** |
| 95.2% | 97.1% | **+1.9%** |
| 98.0% | 98.9% | **+0.9%** |

### Why It Persists

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Lottery preference | Bettors pay premium for upside potential |
| Probability neglect | Cannot distinguish 1% from 5% |
| Entertainment value | Longshots more exciting to bet |
| Overconfidence | Belief in private info on underdogs |

**Caveat:** This bias is documented in horse racing and sports betting. It has NOT been validated on Polymarket with historical data.

# EXPECTED VALUE ANALYSIS

![E(X) Analysis](results/visualizations/expected_value_analysis.png)

## E(X) Formula

```
Net E(X) = Gross Edge - Spread
E(X) per trade = $25 × Net Edge / Price

Where:
  Gross Edge = 2% (from research, UNVALIDATED)
  Spread = Actual bid-ask from order book
```

## Portfolio Outcomes: 7 Trades

**If ALL 7 win:** +$13.19 profit (+7.5% ROI)
**If 6 win, 1 loses:** ~-$12 loss (-6.9% ROI)
**If 5 win, 2 lose:** ~-$37 loss (-21% ROI)

### Probability Analysis

| Wins | Probability (0% edge) | Probability (2% edge) | Profit |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 7/7 | 64.7% | 74.8% | +$13.19 |
| 6/7 | 28.4% | 22.0% | ~-$12 |
| 5/7 | 6.2% | 3.0% | ~-$37 |
| <5 | 0.7% | 0.2% | worse |

**P(Profit) = P(7/7 wins)**
- If market efficient: **64.7%**
- If 2% edge exists: **74.8%**

## E(X) by Edge Scenario

| Assumed Edge | Total E(X) | ROI | P(Profit) |
|--------------|------------|-----|-----------|
| 0% (efficient) | $0.00 | 0.0% | 64.7% |
| 1% | $1.44 | 0.8% | 69.5% |
| **2%** | **$2.88** | **1.6%** | **74.8%** |
| 3% | $4.32 | 2.5% | 79.8% |
| 4% | $5.76 | 3.3% | 84.5% |

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Hit Rate Analysis

| Metric | 0% Edge (Efficient) | 2% Edge (Bias Exists) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Avg win probability | 93.6% | 95.6% |
| Expected wins | 6.55 / 7 | 6.69 / 7 |
| Expected losses | 0.45 / 7 | 0.31 / 7 |
| P(all 7 win) | 62.8% | 72.8% |
| **P(at least 1 loss)** | **37.2%** | **27.2%** |

## Outcome Probability Distribution

| Wins | Losses | Probability | Cumulative | Profit | E(X) Contribution |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 7 | 0 | 62.8% | 100% | +$12.07 | +$7.58 |
| 6 | 1 | 30.3% | 37.2% | -$14.66 | -$4.44 |
| 5 | 2 | 6.1% | 6.9% | -$41.38 | -$2.54 |
| 4 | 3 | 0.7% | 0.7% | -$68.11 | -$0.46 |
| ≤3 | ≥4 | <0.1% | <0.1% | -$95 to -$175 | ~$0 |

**Critical insight:** You need ALL 7 to win to profit. One loss puts you negative.

## Maker vs Taker Positions

| Scenario | Taker (Market Order) | Maker (Limit Order) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| E(X) with 0% edge | +$0.09 | +$0.52 |
| E(X) with 2% edge | +$3.84 | +$4.27 |
| ROI with 0% edge | +0.1% | +0.3% |
| ROI with 2% edge | +2.2% | +2.4% |

Maker orders eliminate spread costs but may not fill.

## Correlation Warning

5 of 7 trades are NFL-related. These are NOT independent:
- NFL labor dispute / lockout would affect all
- Playoff seeding affects multiple teams
- Award voting influenced by same narratives

**True P(at least 1 loss) is likely 40-45%** due to correlation, not 37.2%.

## Position Sizing

With $175 across 7 markets:
- Max loss per market: $25 (14% of portfolio)
- If all lose: $175 (100%)
- Kelly fraction suggests smaller sizing, but $25 minimum for practical trading

---

# PROJECTIONS

## Single Round ($175 deployed, ~3-4 week settlement)

**Timeline:** NFL markets settle by Super Bowl (Feb 9, 2026). Rob Jetten market TBD.

| Scenario | E(X) | Final Value | ROI | Annualized |
|----------|------|-------------|-----|------------|
| All 7 win | +$13.19 | $188.19 | +7.5% | ~98-130% |
| Expected (2% edge) | +$2.88 | $177.88 | +1.6% | ~21-28% |
| Expected (0% edge) | $0.00 | $175.00 | 0.0% | 0% |

## Multiple Rounds (if reinvesting)

Assuming 2% edge and ~75% win rate per round:

| Rounds | E(Capital) | P(Still Profitable) |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | $177.88 | 74.8% |
| 5 | $189.71 | ~60% |
| 10 | $203.28 | ~50% |
| 20 | $233.36 | ~40% |

**Note:** Variance is high. A single loss in early rounds significantly impacts trajectory.
