# Financial Markets Strategy: BTC $1M

## STATUS: NO TRADE

The original analysis was **wrong**.

## Market Rules

| Outcome | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| BTC hits $1M before GTA VI | YES wins |
| GTA VI releases before BTC hits $1M | NO wins |
| **Neither by July 31, 2026** | **Resolves 50/50** |

## Why 48.5%?

The price isn't reflecting P(BTC > $1M). It's reflecting:

**P(GTA VI delayed past July 2026)**

If GTA VI slips past the deadline, market resolves 50/50. Anyone who bought below 50% profits.

## The "Jesus Returning" Pattern

Same structure as other meme markets:
- "Will Jesus return before 2027?" - trades near 5%
- People aren't betting on Jesus returning
- They're betting on the 50/50 resolution trigger

From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/bet-against-christ-s-return-pays-5-5-annual-gain-on-polymarket): "Many participants are treating the contract as a financial instrument with a clear resolution path and low volatility on one side of the trade."

## Why Black-Scholes Was Wrong

I applied options math to a market that isn't pricing probability of BTC movement. It's pricing:

1. P(GTA VI releases on time)
2. P(Market resolves to 50/50)
3. Entertainment/meme value

The 48.5% is potentially rational if you think there's ~50% chance GTA VI slips.

## Conclusion

**No tradeable edge.** This is a bet on Rockstar's release schedule, not BTC price dynamics.
