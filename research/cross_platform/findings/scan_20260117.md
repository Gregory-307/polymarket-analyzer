## Root Cause Analysis

### Kalshi Market Composition (Verified)

After paginating through Kalshi's API:
- **Total open markets scanned**: 5000+
- **Sports parlays (KXMVE*, KXNFL*)**: 100%
- **Political/financial markets**: 0% open

Kalshi series status:
- `PRES` (Presidential): status="finalized"
- `SENATE`: status="finalized"
- `HOUSE`: status="finalized"
- `FED`: No active markets found

### Polymarket Market Composition

- **Political markets**: 130 (Trump, elections, policy)
- **Crypto markets**: 12 (BTC, ETH)
- **Sports markets**: ~50

### Why No Overlap

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Kalshi focus | Sports betting (parlays) |
| Political timing | 2024 election cycle ended |
| Market status | Kalshi political = finalized |

## Conclusion

**Cross-platform arbitrage is not currently viable** between Polymarket and Kalshi.

The infrastructure works (market matching, price comparison), but the platforms have zero market overlap because:
1. Kalshi's open markets are 100% sports
2. Kalshi's political markets are already resolved
3. Polymarket doesn't have the same sports parlay products

## When This Could Change

- New Kalshi political markets open (2028 election cycle?)
- Kalshi adds crypto markets
- Polymarket adds same-sport products
