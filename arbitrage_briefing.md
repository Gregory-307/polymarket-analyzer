# Arbitrage Analysis

## Result

**No opportunities found.**

Scanned 100 Polymarket markets. All binary markets sum to exactly $1.00 within rounding. Multi-outcome markets similarly efficient.

## Why

Polymarket has active market makers. Arbitrage windows close within seconds. This scanner captures a point-in-time snapshot - would need continuous monitoring to catch brief windows.

## What This Means

The strategy is sound mathematically. The market is too efficient for a periodic scanner to capture opportunities. Would need:
- Real-time websocket feeds
- Sub-second execution
- Likely not worth the infrastructure cost for retail

## Conclusion

Arbitrage exists in theory. In practice, Polymarket is efficient. Moving on.
