# Arbitrage Scan Results - January 17, 2026

## Scan Parameters
- **Time**: 2026-01-17 01:23:10 UTC
- **Platform**: Polymarket
- **Strategy**: single_arb (YES + NO != $1)
- **Markets Scanned**: 100

## Results

**Single Arbitrage Opportunities Found: 0**

## Interpretation

No binary arbitrage opportunities were detected in this scan. This means:

1. For all 100 markets scanned, YES + NO prices sum to approximately $1.00
2. Market makers and arbitrageurs have already closed any price gaps
3. The 0.3% threshold was not breached on any market

## What This Tells Us

- Polymarket's markets are relatively efficient at the time of scan
- Arbitrage windows, when they exist, are likely short-lived (minutes)
- A single snapshot may miss opportunities that appeared earlier or later

## Limitations

- Only scanned 100 markets (API limit per request)
- Single point-in-time snapshot
- Binary markets only (multi-outcome arbitrage requires different scanning)
- No historical data to compare frequency of opportunities

## Raw Data

Saved to: `research/arbitrage/data/scan_20260117_012310.json`

## Next Steps for Real Validation

1. Run scans more frequently (hourly, daily) to build a dataset
2. Compare scan times to market activity levels
3. Implement multi-outcome arbitrage scanning
4. Track when opportunities DO appear and how long they persist
