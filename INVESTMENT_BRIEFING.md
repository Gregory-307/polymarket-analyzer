# POLYMARKET INVESTMENT BRIEFING
## Honest Analysis - January 16, 2026

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This briefing presents **potential** trading opportunities based on the favorite-longshot bias theory.

**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** The edge estimates are based on academic research in other markets (horse racing, sports betting). **We have NOT validated this bias exists on Polymarket** with actual historical data.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Markets Analyzed | 200 |
| Total Volume | $98,235,792 |
| Markets at 99%+ (NO EDGE) | 115 |
| Markets at 95-99% (Minimal Edge) | 25 |
| **Markets at 90-95% (Opportunity Zone)** | **12** |
| Volume in Opportunity Zone | $18,964,862 |

# MARKET DISTRIBUTION

![Honest Summary](results/visualizations/honest_summary.png)

## The Reality

- **115 markets (57%)** are priced at 99%+ — these have **NO EDGE**
- **25 markets (13%)** are at 95-99% — minimal theoretical edge
- **12 markets (6%)** are at 90-95% — **this is the only opportunity zone**
- **48 markets (24%)** are below 90% — too uncertain for this strategy

# THE THEORY (HONEST ASSESSMENT)

## What the Research Says

The favorite-longshot bias is documented in:
- Kahneman & Tversky (1979) - Prospect Theory
- NBER Working Paper 15923 - "Explaining the Favorite-Long Shot Bias"

**The claim:** Markets priced at 90-95% may actually resolve at 93-98%, giving 2-5% edge.

## What We DON'T Know

1. **Does this bias exist on Polymarket?** — We have no historical data to verify
2. **What is the actual edge?** — Our estimates are assumptions, not measurements
3. **Are these markets efficient?** — Crypto-native markets may differ from traditional betting

## The Honest Conclusion

> The favorite-longshot bias is real in academic literature, but I cannot prove it exists on Polymarket. Proceeding with this strategy is a bet on the theory being applicable here.

# OPPORTUNITY ZONE: 90-95%

![Specific Trades](results/visualizations/specific_trades.png)

These are the **only markets with theoretical edge potential**:

## TOP OPPORTUNITIES BY VOLUME

### 1. Chicago Bears Super Bowl 2026
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Side** | NO |
| **Price** | 94.5% |
| **Volume** | $9,540,888 |
| **Liquidity** | $1,496,335 |

**Analysis:** Bears won't win the Super Bowl. Market prices this at 94.5%. If the bias theory holds, true probability is ~96-97%.

---

### 2. Houston Texans Super Bowl 2026
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Side** | NO |
| **Price** | 91.0% |
| **Volume** | $8,294,185 |
| **Liquidity** | $1,575,878 |

**Analysis:** Texans at 91% NO is actually in the sweet spot. Lower probability = potentially more edge.

---

### 3. 49ers NFC Championship 2026
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Side** | NO |
| **Price** | 90.4% |
| **Volume** | $639,629 |
| **Liquidity** | $74,808 |

**Analysis:** 49ers won't win NFC. At 90.4%, this is at the lower end of our zone - potentially more edge but also more risk.

---

### 4. DOGE Budget Cuts <$50B in 2025
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Side** | YES |
| **Price** | 93.3% |
| **Volume** | $320,285 |
| **Liquidity** | $2,674 |

**Analysis:** Market expects DOGE to cut less than $50B. At 93.3% YES, this is in the opportunity zone. Low liquidity is a concern.

---

# WHAT I WOULD ACTUALLY RECOMMEND

## If You Want to Test This Strategy

**Start small.** This is unvalidated. Here's a conservative approach:

### Test Portfolio ($100)

| Market | Side | Allocation | Amount |
|--------|------|------------|--------|
| Houston Texans Super Bowl | NO | 30% | $30 |
| Chicago Bears Super Bowl | NO | 30% | $30 |
| 49ers NFC Championship | NO | 20% | $20 |
| Cash Reserve | — | 20% | $20 |

**Why these?**
- All in 90-95% zone (actual opportunity area)
- High volume ($8M+) means good liquidity
- All sports markets (same category, but diversified teams)

### Expected Outcomes

**If theory is correct:**
- Win rate: ~93-97% (slightly higher than market price)
- Expected profit: ~$2-5 (2-5% edge on $80 deployed)

**If theory is wrong:**
- Win rate: ~91-94% (equal to market price)
- Expected profit: ~$0 (paying transaction costs only)

**If we hit a black swan (5-9% chance):**
- One or more positions loses 100%
- Potential loss: $20-80

# MARKETS TO AVOID

## 99%+ Markets (NO EDGE)

The following have **ZERO theoretical edge** because they're already near ceiling:

- All NFL Rookie of the Year "Will X NOT win" markets at 99.95%
- Markets already resolved or near-certain

**Do not trade these** — even if the research is correct, there's no room for edge.

---

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Quantified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Black swan (favorite loses) | 5-10% per trade | 100% loss of position | Position sizing, diversification |
| Theory doesn't apply to Polymarket | Unknown | 0% edge, lose tx fees | Start small, track results |
| Platform risk (Polygon/USDC) | Low | Total loss | Don't overexpose to crypto |
| Execution slippage | Low | Reduced returns | Use limit orders, high-liquidity markets |

## Position Sizing Rule

**Never risk more than 5% of bankroll on any single market.**

---

# HONEST BOTTOM LINE

## What I Know
- 12 markets exist in the 90-95% opportunity zone
- These have $19M in volume and good liquidity
- The favorite-longshot bias is academically documented

## What I Don't Know
- Whether the bias exists on Polymarket specifically
- What the actual edge is (if any)
- Whether these markets are already efficiently priced

## My Recommendation

**This is speculative.** The theory is sound, but unvalidated on this platform.

If you proceed:
1. Allocate small amount ($100 or less)
2. Focus ONLY on 90-95% zone
3. Track every trade to measure actual performance
4. Build your own dataset to validate (or invalidate) the theory

**Do NOT** bet the 99%+ markets. There is no edge there, period.
